# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing
**Summary** 

Overall this week has been challenging. Never heard about Traceability or Observability before, but it makes sense. Xray was indeed difficult and took me forever to finish that part. I did have less time this week to give to the bootcamp and tried to cram when possible. I ran into various issues, from command line issues to docker issues, however, I was able to solve them myself. 

## More detailed issues stated here
1. Aws create group new line segments messing up CLI for some reason" removed slashes and command worked
2. AWS create sampling rule : did not need to be in backend flask directory
3. Missing a comma in user activities dict libraries formatting issue
4. Issue with env var - had to reload workspace - ensure I deleted previous workspaces
5. Issue with Docker - had decompose down then back up
