# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing
**Summary** 

Overall this week has been challenging. Never heard about Traceability or Observability before, but it makes sense. Xray was indeed difficult and took me forever to finish that part. CLoudwatch worked well, as well as rollbar. I did have less time this week to give to the bootcamp and tried to cram when possible. I ran into various issues, from command line issues to docker issues, and python issues, however, I was able to solve them myself. 

## More detailed issues stated here
1. Aws create group new line segments messing up CLI for some reason" removed slashes and command worked
2. AWS create sampling rule : did not need to be in backend flask directory
3. Missing a comma in user activities dict libraries formatting issue
4. Issue with env var - had to reload workspace - ensure I deleted previous workspaces
5. Issue with Docker - had decompose down then back up
6. Python code issue: realized you cannot use hypen in comment to describe a word, i used " # X-RAY --- " in my comment and it did not act the same as if it was just lowercase , i believe it is due to python thinking i was going to create a multi-line comment and I didnt.
