# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
Overall this week was a bit more difficult, but more fun! I enjoyed getting my hands dirty in gitpod with docker, react, python files, and some CLI commands! One bump I ran into was overwriting the import userfeed with notification feed in the main app.js file. Troubleshooting it was a great challenge! Quizzes were informative and DBs are working so far. 
## **Feb 18**
Started watching live stream, had to watch recording due to other things scheduled at the time. only got through half way along with following along.
## **FEB 19**
Finished the live session and was successful with the container and displaying the site.
## **FEB 20**
Created DBs, no issues. Pretty straight forward once I watched through the entire video to find out which commands to use.
## **FEB 21**
Finished building the notifications portion of the app/website. Ran into many issues at first, but after going back and reviewing definitely human error all the times. :D I mistakenly overwrote the import userfeed with notifications feed and didn't notice until the end when i was trying to run it from port 3000 and was showing no feed, just a blank purple screen. I reviewed all the code that I changed and realized where I messed up, took me a bit to find but was definitely relieving and proud moment when I was able to fix my own goof!
## **FEB 24**
I completed the 2 quizzes and wrote my Overall Summary of what I did. I am also going to watch some of Adrian Cantrills Docker videos today to get a better understanding of Docker and all of its components.
