# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
## **Feb 18**
Started watching live stream, had to watch recording due to other things scheduled at the time. only got through half way along with following along.
## **FEB 19**
Finished the live session and was successful with the container and displaying the site.
## **FEB 21**
Finished building the notifications portion of the app/website. Ran into many issues at first, but after going back and reviewing definitely human error all the times. :D I mistakenly overwrote the import userfeed with notifications feed and didn't notice until the end when i was trying to run it from port 3000 and was showing no feed, just a blank purple screen. I reviewed all the code that I changed and realized where I messed up, took me a bit to find but was definitely relieving and proud moment when I was able to fix my own goof!
