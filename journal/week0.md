  Got through most of the extra videos for billing budget set up, took me awhile because i had to stop and go do things in between and would come back to realize all my progress was lost. So I had to redo my environment a couple times due to that, atleast until i got to the portion where we added commands that would save out settings.

  Completed watching all the main videos, and completed all the set up for my account. Learned some AWS CLI and where to find the rest of the commands as well as examples! very helpful!

  Worked on and completed Logical Architectual Diagram on Lucid Chart. Took me awhile to get the hang of it, but once i figured it out it got more fun! tweaked it a bit to make it mine. I still had issues with the momento SVG, i somehow lost the eyeball so i just used a circle shape with the same color(No one can notice). I followed along with the chart diagram video for most of it. Looking forward for more. I plan on watching Chirag and Ashishs videos tomorrow and complete the quiz as well! Cheers!
